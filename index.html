            <p> Dr. Jones was born in Jackson, Mississippi, but spent most of her formative years in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1989, she graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Electrical Engineering. After graduation, she took a job with IBM in Research Triangle Park, NC. After working at IBM four years, she realized that a career in engineering would not satisfy her completely. She longed for a career that involved face-to-face
            
            problem solving and life-long relationships with people</p>
